Minecraft-Bukkit--PlayerSwap
============================

This isn't anything really important.

This was made in less than an hour, or maybe even less than half an hour :P



DERIVED FROM: codename_B's playerswap plugin.

What I edited: added text to occur after a swap occurs, and added a command for it. Organized what was already coded to make everything neater and stuff :P




Anyways, because I am lazy and stuff, there will be no comments explaining EVERY thing.
Maybe sometime in the future, I'll add comments.
